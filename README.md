This is a passion project created by wanting to keep my recipes all in one place - in a pretty easy way.

Currently, I am using the SQL Alchemy for the purpose of not having to write raw SQL queries, but instead to refresh my knowledge 
on Object-Relational Mapping in Python by referencing queries through Python.

The front end is built with simple HTML and Javascript modifications. I hope to expand my knowledge with these to deepen my 
abilities to customize.

The original scope of this project is to create a simple front-end application with these specified use cases:
1. Add recipe to a database
2. Filter recipes in database by different things like ingredients, mood, description, type of meal
3. View all recipes in a "cookbook" format

Now, upon building the basic framework in such short time, I have added some new goals for the project:
4. Clean inputs and use NLP to parse the recipe instructions into steps
5. Connect to an LLM API to describe the mood and desires and have a recipe recommendation to be added to the cookbook
6. Filter by cuisines
7. User Account interface so each account can save recipes to their cookbook, add recipes to master database

I'm sure the list will keep growing. Stay tuned!
